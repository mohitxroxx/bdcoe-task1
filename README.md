# bdcoe-task1

This is my project for the backend task, I used nodejs/expressjs for the basic operations, Its working perfctly fine in postman.
I tried to add the front end to it, but only was able to create post request to store the transactions to the data base.

I also used nodemailer for the additional task to send mails using gmail smtp


Here are some of the screenshots of the basic operations performed by the API
